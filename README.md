## Notes:

### Org provided instructions/background

- Guidebook link - https://docs.opentech.fund/otf-application-guidebook/our-funds-and-fellowships/free-and-open-source-software-foss-sustainability-fund
  - Is this the repo for that page? - https://github.com/OpenTechFund/application-guide

### Strategy

- They are into `anti-censorship`, `cyber security`, `privacy` so we should;
  - focus on the **'freedom**' aspect
  - focus on the '**data ownership**' aspect
    - particular the "if we don't make this now, it'll be `facebook-mocap`in a year
    - i.e. use the "Build the platform BEFORE there is a paid alternative" thing to add a sense of urgency
      i.e. "Imagine if Blender hit `v2.8` (a legendary update) BEFORE Maya was the industry standard" vibe
- etc
